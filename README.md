---

## Tech Stack (Implemented / Recommended)

**Front-end**

* HTML5 (semantic markup)
* CSS3 (variables) — optionally Sass/SCSS for maintainability
* JavaScript (ES6+) — modular for components
* Optional: jQuery (if used in specific components)
* Layout: CSS Grid / Flexbox (compatible with Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind if you prefer)

**Dev tooling**

* Visual Studio Code (recommended)
* Node.js + npm for build tooling (Sass, autoprefixer, image optimization, dev server)
* Build tools: Vite / webpack / gulp (pick one per project needs)

**Back-end (integration options)**

* JavaScript Fullstack: React (Admin) + Node/Express + MongoDB/Postgres
* PHP: Laravel + MySQL
* Serverless: Next.js / Supabase or Firebase (Auth + DB)

> This repository contains the static front-end. Back-end and admin options are integration guides and API stubs.

## Development Workflow & Tools

Recommended local developer setup:

1. Install Node.js (LTS) and npm.
2. Use Visual Studio Code with extensions: Live Server, Prettier, ESLint, EditorConfig, GitLens.
3. Add dev dependencies if required (sass, postcss, autoprefixer, imagemin, live-server).
4. Use Prettier & ESLint for consistent code style and quality.

---

## How to run locally

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/barab-template.git
cd barab-template

# If using tooling:
npm install

# Start dev server (example)
npm run dev
# or
npx live-server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port displayed by your dev server).

---

## NPM Scripts (example)

Add these to your `package.json` to streamline development:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "live-server ./ --port=3000 --open=./index.html",
  "sass": "sass --watch scss:css --style=expanded",
  "build:css": "sass scss:css --style=compressed && postcss css/*.css --use autoprefixer -d dist/css",
  "optimize:images": "imagemin src/images/* --out-dir=dist/images"
}
```

## Admin Panel — Design & Implementation Plan

To make Barab production-ready for a restaurant business, include an Admin Panel with the following objectives:

### Goals

* Full CRUD for menu items, categories, modifiers and prices.
* Reservations & table availability management.
* Order management (delivery / takeaway) and status workflows.
* CMS for promotional banners, content and coupons.
* Analytics dashboard: orders, revenue, best-selling items.
* Staff user management with roles/permissions and audit logs.

### Recommended Stacks (pick one)

* **Option A (JS Fullstack):** React Admin + Node/Express REST API + MongoDB/Postgres
* **Option B (PHP):** Laravel + Blade or Vue + MySQL
* **Option C (Serverless):** Next.js Admin + Supabase (Postgres + Auth)

---

## Data Model (Simplified)

```
users (staff): id, name, email, role, password_hash, last_login
menu_items: id, name, description, category_id, price, image_url, is_active, modifiers
categories: id, name, slug, sort_order
orders: id, customer_name, items[{menu_item_id, qty, price}], total, status, created_at
reservations: id, customer_name, date_time, party_size, status, contact_info
coupons: code, discount_type, value, expires_at, usage_limit
```

## Admin UI Features & Quick Implementation Notes

**Features**

* Role-based access (Admin, Manager, Staff)
* Data tables with search, filtering, and bulk actions
* Modal forms for create/edit with inline image uploads
* Real-time order notifications via WebSocket or polling
* Export orders/analytics to CSV

**Notes**

* Image uploads: use presigned S3/Cloud Storage URLs for scalability.
* Payments: integrate Stripe (or local gateways) when taking payments online.
* Deploy the admin using Docker for consistency (DigitalOcean, AWS, or Heroku are good options).

## Customization Guide (Quick Wins for Clients)

* **Brand & Colors:** edit CSS variables (`:root { --primary: #E94E1B; }`) or `_variables.scss`.
* **Typography:** update Google Fonts link in `<head>`.
* **Menu Content:** edit `menu.html` or connect a dynamic API to render items.
* **Images:** replace `/images/` assets and use `srcset` for responsive images.
* **Forms:** point forms to server endpoints or serverless functions and add server-side validation.

---

## Performance, SEO & Accessibility

* **Performance:** use responsive `<picture>` tags, `loading="lazy"`, minify CSS/JS and convert images to WebP where possible.
* **SEO:** semantic markup, meta tags, and structured data (LocalBusiness, Menu schema).
* **Accessibility:** proper alt text, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation and color-contrast checks.

---

## Deployment Recommendations & CI/CD

**Static hosting:** Netlify, Vercel or GitHub Pages for the front-end.

**Simple GitHub Actions (example)**

* Build CSS and assets on push to `main`.
* Publish `dist/` to GitHub Pages or deploy to Netlify/Vercel.

**Admin & API:** containerize with Docker and deploy with a cloud provider (DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS, or Heroku). Use managed Postgres or MongoDB.

---

## Security & Privacy

* Enforce HTTPS and HSTS.
* Server-side input validation and sanitization.
* Store passwords using bcrypt/argon2 and protect secrets with environment variables.
* Implement role-based access control for admin endpoints.

## How to Pitch This Project to Clients / Recruiters

**One-line:** A conversion-first, mobile-optimized restaurant front-end with a clear path to a scalable admin and order management backend.

**Selling points for clients**

* Faster go-to-market: launch a branded site quickly and start taking reservations/orders.
* Higher conversions: UI designed to reduce friction between discovery and checkout/reservation.
* Low maintenance: static front-end with easy admin integration options.
* Clear upgrade path: add real-time order handling, payment and analytics in phases.

**Interview/Case talk points**

* Explain the design choices that improve conversions (CTA placement, menu layout).
* Demonstrate the path from static templates → integrated SaaS (Admin + DB + Payments).
* Discuss trade-offs: static speed vs. dynamic complexity, scalability choices.

---

## Roadmap / Next Improvements

* Build a React/Vue admin with real-time order handling.
* Add headless CMS (Strapi/Sanity) for content management.
* Localization (i18n), multi-currency support and multiple branches support.
* Automated visual regression tests and performance monitoring.
